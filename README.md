# Tip Calculator - Splitter
This my attempt on a challenge on frontendmenter.io. It is a challenge to improve frontend skills. In this task I'm assigned to create a calculator for tips. 

## Choice of tech
As I am a fan of vue.js. I've used it on this project, I've also attempted to use vite and typescript for the first time on this.
